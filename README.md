# This is a Javascript restoration of a selected screen from «Naranjas» (2002) by Julia Masvernat

[Naranjas](http://juliamasvernat.com.ar/img/naranjas.swf) is an interactive animation artwork built in Flash by the argentinian artist Julia Masvernat. I've chosen the *“purple level”* from the original project and had a try at rewriting it using modern web technologies like ES6 and CSS Animations.</p>

Being a 2002 project, I had to deal with some scenarios that weren't around at the time of its conception, like touch interactions or a much wider diversity of devices and screen sizes. A detailed tutorial of this new media restoration work is coming up soon.
